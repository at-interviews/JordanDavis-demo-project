### NOTES

The search bar could have been used to filter items present in the list
But I used it to run a new search against the api with a keyword. 

The UI is just terrible, didn't spend a ton of time making it super pretty, just readable.

Some map optimizations could have been made, like centering and zooming the map better.
Didn't add custom images, just used Glide to show a download.
